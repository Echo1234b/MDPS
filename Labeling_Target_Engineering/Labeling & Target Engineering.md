 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib, backtrader
 Functions:
Calculates simple and log returns based on close prices over multiple timeframes.
Supports configurable return windows and threshold-based labeling (e.g., bullish if > x%).



🔹 Profit Zone Tagger
Role: Labels regions of potential profit capture based on future price moves and trade logic.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, NumPy, bt, custom rule-based labeling functions
 Functions:
Tags candles or zones that lie within optimal profit-taking areas (e.g., after breakout or pattern confirmation).
Generates binary/multi-class labels for ML targets like "High Profit Zone", "Missed Opportunity", etc.



🔹 Risk/Reward Labeler
Role: Assigns labels based on calculated risk-to-reward ratios for trade setups.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, NumPy, pyfolio, QuantLib
 Functions:
Calculates entry, stop-loss, and target levels; computes R/R and assigns labels like “High-RR”, “Low-RR”, “Negative-RR”.
Useful in filtering poor trades and balancing class distributions in classification tasks.



🔹 Target Delay Shifter
Role: Aligns future targets with the correct input features by time-shifting labels.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, NumPy, compatible with time series split libraries
 Functions:
Shifts future return/label series backward to align with current features.
Enables supervised training with accurate causality (e.g., today’s input predicts future outcome).

🔹 Volatility Bucketizer
Role: Classifies market states into different volatility regimes for conditional learning.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, SciPy, sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer, arch, statsmodels
 Functions:
Buckets historical volatility into bins (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
Enables creation of volatility-sensitive labels or multi-model training by regime.



🔹 Drawdown Calculator
Role: Computes maximum drawdown over a future horizon as a risk-oriented label.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, pyfolio, ffn, custom logic
 Functions:
Measures peak-to-trough drop after each time point and stores the max future drawdown.
Useful for labeling high-risk zones and for risk-aware strategy training.



🔹 MFE Calculator (Maximum Favorable Excursion)
Role: Measures the best-case price movement after entry to evaluate unrealized opportunity.
 Tools/Libraries:
backtrader, bt, pandas, custom rolling functions
 Functions:


Calculates MFE from each candle over a fixed lookahead.


Can be used to define “missed profits”, “optimal exits”, and train reward-aware models.



5.2 Label Transformers & Classifiers
🔹 Candle Direction Labeler
Role: Generates labels indicating basic candle direction (e.g., bullish, bearish, neutral).
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, NumPy
 Functions:
Compares close vs open to assign simple labels: 1 (bullish), -1 (bearish), 0 (doji/neutral).
Supports optional thresholds (e.g., body size must exceed X%) to avoid noise labeling.

🔹 Directional Label Encoder
Role: Converts various directional labels into numeric or one-hot encoded form for ML models.
 Tools/Libraries:
sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
 Functions:


Encodes symbolic direction labels ('up', 'down', 'neutral') into numeric classes.
Supports multiple encoding formats for classifier compatibility.

🔹 Candle Outcome Labeler
Role: Assigns labels based on post-candle behavior (e.g., breakout, reversal, continuation).
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, custom labeling rules
 Functions:
Observes price action after the candle to classify the outcome (e.g., strong continuation, failed breakout).
Useful for teaching models to detect setup success vs. failure.

🔹 Threshold Labeler
Role: Applies binary or multi-class labels based on specific threshold criteria.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, NumPy
 Functions:
Labels samples based on custom conditions: e.g., return > 1%, volatility > 2%.
Flexible logic for supervised classification or ranking.

🔹 Classification Binner
Role: Converts continuous target variables (e.g., returns) into categorical bins.
 Tools/Libraries:
sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer, pandas.qcut, numpy.digitize
 Functions:
Supports equal-width, quantile-based, or custom binning strategies.
Ideal for transforming regression targets into class labels (e.g., "low", "medium", "high return").

🔹 Reversal Point Annotator
Role: Detects and labels pivot points in price that indicate potential reversals.
 Tools/Libraries:
scipy.signal.find_peaks, pandas, ta, technical
 Functions:
Annotates swing highs/lows using price patterns and volatility filters.
Helps build reversal prediction models or define entry/exit signals.

🔹 Volatility Breakout Tagger
Role: Labels candles where volatility expansion leads to significant directional moves.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, NumPy, ta.volatility (e.g., ATR, Bollinger Band breakout)
 Functions:
Identifies breakout events based on volatility thresholds.
Useful in tagging momentum entries or breakout setups.

🔹 Noisy Candle Detector
Role: Flags candles that contain high noise or uncertainty (e.g., long wicks, doji patterns).
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas, custom candlestick analyzers
 Functions:
Applies rules based on body-to-shadow ratio or volatility to detect "uncertain" signals.
Used for filtering or as a negative training signal.

🔹 Time-To-Target Labeler
Role: Measures how many bars it takes to hit a target (profit or stop) from current point.
 Tools/Libraries:
backtrader, bt, NumPy, pandas
 Functions:
Calculates time-to-profit or time-to-stop in bars or minutes.
Can be used to train time-sensitive models or for exit timing decisions.

🔹 Target Distribution Visualizer
Role: Visualizes label distribution across dataset to analyze imbalance and label quality.
 Tools/Libraries:
matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, pandas
 Functions:
Plots histograms or bar plots of class frequencies, return distributions, or thresholds.
Helps refine labeling strategy and ensure balanced supervised learning.




5.3 Label Quality Assessment
🔹 Label Noise Detector
Role: Detects mislabeled, low-confidence, or contradictory targets (e.g., direction flipped, threshold misapplied, leakage/temporal mistakes) before training.
 Tools/Libraries:
cleanlab (confident learning), scikit-learn (cross‑val predicted probabilities, IsolationForest, OneClassSVM), pyod, pandas, NumPy, optional mapie (conformal prediction).
 Functions:
Estimates per-sample label error probability using out-of-fold predicted probabilities; surfaces candidates to flip / drop / relabel.
Flags temporal contradictions (e.g., label says “hit target” but backtest shows otherwise), outliers where features strongly disagree with labels, and creates an issue report with severity and suggested fix.

🔹 Label Consistency Analyzer
Role: Verifies that label definitions are internally consistent across time, thresholds, and multi-timeframe variants; ensures reproducibility of the labeling schema.
 Tools/Libraries:
pandas validation suites, Great Expectations / pandera, scikit-learn metrics (Cohen’s κ, MCC, agreement rates), statistical tests (KS, PSI, JSD) for stability checks.
 Functions:
Computes agreement matrices between alternative labelers (e.g., returns vs. breakout‑based), κ-coefficients over sliding windows, and highlights low‑agreement segments.
Enforces rule/constraint checks (e.g., if future return > threshold ⇒ class must be positive), audits boundary cases near thresholds, and reports parameter sensitivity (label flips when rules slightly change).

Integration Tip: Run the Label Noise Detector first to prune suspect samples, then apply the Label Consistency Analyzer to validate the final schema across windows/timeframes. Export both results (masks + audit tables) to your experiment tracker (e.g., MLflow) for traceability.
